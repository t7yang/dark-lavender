Here is some of the styling rules, to preview the theme design see the code snippet image below:

- Built in keyword, variable, function, class... with font style italic, if you see something dispaly in italic, just do not re-assgin or change it value.
- Keywords not for declaration (`for`, `while`, `import`) are color as purple.
- Keywords for declaration (`var`, `class`, `extends`) are color as red.
- Functions value are color as teal.
- Built in and custom types are color as yellow.
- Parameter and variable are color as orange, deeper if the variable is readonly.

To emphasize the effect of italic, I use Victor Mono font. If you don't like curly italic font, consider Fira Code and Jetbrain Mono. Check the Fonts section below.
